## Example: Httpbin

This example demonstrates a basic deployment configuration that supports a local instance of httpbin running under a configuration that could be used for a production deployment as well.  

The deployment files are in the directory `httpbin`  

In particular, note that httpbin-virtual-service definition is the same for both tls and non-tls. It is the gateway definition that changes to incorporate external TLS access.  

**First**, create a localhost entry for `local.httpbin.org` that resolves to the istio-ingressgateway EXTERNAL-IP:  

```bash
$ kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway -n istio-system  # get the IP for the istio-ingressgateway
$ hostess add local.httpbin.org EXTERNAL-IP             # create a local entry, requires admin password
```

**deploy httpbin without tls**:  

```bash
$ inv httpbin.deploy
```

From your browser you can now go to `http://local.httpbin.org` to access the locally running httpbin service without tls.  

**deploy httpbin with tls**  

```bash
$ inv httpbin.deploy -tls
```

The deploy will generate the necessary certificates for `local.httpbin.org` using the local Root CA and deploy these to istio-system on minikube.

You can now use `https://local.httpbin.org`    

Use curl to display header and certificate validation info  
```bash
$ curl -v -HHost:local.httpbin.org --cacert local.httpbin.org.crt "https://local.httpbin.org/status/418"
```

You should see something like the following: (the IPs will match what you used to create the local DNS entry)
```bash
